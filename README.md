# API Gateway Rust
API Gateway + Lambda + Rust cargo project for the [blog post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/going-serverless-with-rust-and-api-gateway-aa5d1502c32e)
and [YouTube video](). Both go over creating an api with API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and the Rust
programming language. Other significant technologies used are DyanmoDB, Docker,
and Terraform.
